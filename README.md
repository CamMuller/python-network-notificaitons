# python-network-notificaiton

A basic python3 script for monitoring network traffic with the ability to search for a device mac address.

Currently I have this scheduled to email me when my wife arrives home and her device connects to the network.

Run as admin and add the requirements into the config file as well as the path to your config file in the main script.
